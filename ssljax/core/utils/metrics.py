    Calculate the Levenshtein edit-distance between two strings.
    The edit distance is the number of characters that need to be
    substituted, inserted, or deleted, to transform s1 into s2.  For
    example, transforming "rain" to "shine" requires three steps,
    consisting of two substitutions and one insertion:
    "rain" -> "sain" -> "shin" -> "shine".  These operations could have
    been done in other orders, but at least three steps are needed.

    Allows specifying the cost of substitution edits (e.g., "a" -> "b"),
    because sometimes it makes sense to assign greater penalties to
    substitutions.

    This also optionally allows transposition edits (e.g., "ab" -> "ba"),
    though this is disabled by default.
